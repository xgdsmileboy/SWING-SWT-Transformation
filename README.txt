This is a project that migrate the SWING Java API to SWT Java API automatically.

NOTE: This is a bachelor degree undergraduate subject project.

In this project I have realized the simple transformation from SWING to SWT,
such as it can change the java file based on SWING to SWT and automatically change the widget from SWING API to SWT(JButton to Button, JPanel to Composite. etc.). 

Also, I have build a graphic user interface for this to have an easy use for users, which can show the main transform procedure.

If you have any question you can contact me at xgd_smileboy@163.com

And if you have any good idear I'll be very glad to exchange idears with you.

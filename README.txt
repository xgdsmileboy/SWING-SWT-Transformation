This is a project that migrates the SWING Java API to SWT Java API automatically.

NOTE: This is a bachelor degree undergraduate subject project.

In this project I have implemented the simple transformation algorithm from SWING to SWT, which can change a java file based on SWING to SWT API and automatically migrate the widget from SWING to SWT API(JButton to Button, JPanel to Composite. etc.). 

Also, I have built a graphic user interface for this task for easy use, which can show the main transform procedure.

If you have any question you can contact me at xgd_smileboy@163.com

Additionally, any other good ideas related automatic API migration is welcomed.
